In one way, it has been a place where I can seek shelter from boredom (I thought that I had shelter,
but immediately realised my grave mistake). In another way, it has been a place where I could observe the working human species (homo 
worko sapiens), in their natural habitat. </p><p>I confess that my opinion about the species is far from good. Doing the same work all day long, 
is for robots or machines in my opinion. If I was there only for a few hours, then they would have undoubtedly shown their professional 
side,but being there for the entire day, they must have decided to drop the act. C’mon, how long can a person keep up an act?!! So I could
witness the Behind the Scenes action, the timed work, the untimed breaks, the small fights and of course, the inevitable boss-bashing. It 
has really been a learning experience for me about what to expect and what not to expect from work. Sort of makes me want to retire 
straight after studies. </p><p>But what to do, stomach has to be filled! Expecting better from my job, when I get one (God knows when !).</p><p>Thats all Folks<br>
Toodles</p><p>PS My first completely solved crossword. Hip hip hurray!!!
