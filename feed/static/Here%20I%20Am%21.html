If you know Malayalam and watch movies then “enganum biriyani undenkilo”. I hosted a blog on Blogger for two years but felt it was
time to move on as I heard rumours about Google stopping Blogger to promote “+”. I decided to move to Tumblr as I thought it looked
very nice. That statement might have informed you to the fact that I am still at an age when I want things that look nice but may
not have any use. </p><p>So I bid a hasty adieu to Blogger with links to my Tumblr account. Then I thought why not learn something about my new home. So I 
went to The Ultimate Reference and searched.</p><p>Imagine my chagrin when I found that it was supposedly a microblogging site. You might be wondering what is wrong with 
micro-blogging. Twitter is a chartbuster and everyone who has any pretensions to being cool regularly uses it to inform everyone 
what cool things they are doing or broadcast cool stuff like the easiest way to become cool. But my experience with Twitter or 
tweeting as they call it has not been that good. I know it is my problem as I have commitment issues and seemed to use it only
during exams. I did not want my blog, my wall, my precious to decay like my twitter account and therefore have decided to not use
Tumblr (which after all is a micro-blogging site).</p><p>So there you are, I am on WordPress. I lasted more than two years on Blogger which is long considering how impulsive I am. As a 
result of that longevity I expect WordPress to survive longer. Let us see what happens. Here is to a long and fruitful partnership
with WordPress, Cheers! As you can see, I have maintained almost everything as it was in Blogger, including the URL, which I have 
to say was one of my better inventions. So please continue following me if you ever did or start following me if you ever didn’t. 
Who knows, I might become a award-winning author one day and you can say proudly to everyone that you used to comment on my blog 
when I was a nobody. Nurturing budding talent and all that you know ;).</p><p>My first proper post will come soon.</p></div>
