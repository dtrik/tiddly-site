As the title suggests, it was to Vaishno Devi.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Vaishno Devi is a temple in Jammu.  It is an important temple for North Indians. It is the first place visited by a newly-wed couple, even before their honeymoon. It features three natural stone statues within a cave depicting three Devis (goddesses). People had to crawl through the cave to reach the statues. But that way has been closed and devotees use artificial tunnels now. </p><p>The journey to the temple starts at the basecamp town of Katra which is around 40km from Jammu proper.  The temple is ~12-13km hike uphill from Katra.  Earlier, everyone had to go to Jammu (rail/road/air) and take transportation to Katra from there. The rail network was recently extended and now there are trains to Katra. </p><p>The paved roads were already very good at least 20 years back (first time we went) and it has only improved since then. There are restrooms and refreshments sprinkled throughout the route.  A highlight are the water fountains with ice cold spring water. A majority of restrooms are in very good condition now (they were very bad earlier). </p><p>The hike can be rather strenuous if you are not used to intense activity. There are several sections which have steep inclines. If you want "Darshan" but are unable/unwilling to navigate the climb, you have several options. There are ponies and palanquins from the startpoint itself. There are electric cars from the midway point as well. These alternates increase the difficulty of the journey for the hiking demographic. </p><p>Planning started early as The Parents are prone to do. The temple is crowded most of the time with queues of 4-5 hours at the top considered normal. We chose the time right before Chaitra Navaratri as it is less crowded. The Plan extended to include Jwalamukhi as well as three associated temples.</p><p>The Parents and The Sister started their journey from Madurai and the rest of us from Bangalore. The three of us reached Delhi on Saturday, 30th March and slept over at the wife's aunt's place. On Sunday morning after a delicious breakfast, we visited the famous Akshardham temple. I have been there before but it was the first time for the wife and her brother. It was an enjoyable visit despite the intense heat.  (Delhi got over its winter a week before we reached. There were blankets visible in most of the houses we went to!)</p><p>The rest came via Chennai and reached on Sunday afternoon. We met up at my friend's place and dumped half our luggage there as half of our trip was to be in Delhi. Then we went to the railway station (code: NDLS) and boarded the Shri Shakti Express (code: 22461) to Katra (code: SVDK). I had a mild headache so I parked myself in the top berth and slept till after dinner. The rest reportedly had an enjoyable dinner of chholey kulcha (the traitors). I sated my hunger with curd. </p><p>We reached very early and then went on to the IRCTC guesthouse in the station itself. We had booked a room for freshening up and lockers for keeping the rest of our luggage. It was very good and neat. The breakfast was also very good.</p><p>After breakfast, wearing matching clothes we started our hike from Katra at around 8:30 AM. We carried only our coats as once you start climbing each gram starts weighing like a kilo.  (Ounce and pound for the people without standards). There is the option of porter for carrying your luggage too. The guesthouse has a pickup and drop facility to the startpoint of the hike (called Banganga). We utilized it and went to the checkpoint where we have to collect a token. This token marks your position in the queue once you are at the top. Alternatively military personnel get passes which provides entry to a separate queue. That queue joins the general queue a bit further ahead. Through some contacts we snagged one such and collected ours. </p><p>Equipped with walking sticks and lots of enthusiasm we started walking.  We pumped ourselves with various liquids whenever there were omens of tiredness. Our primary fuel was the superb sugarcane juice. Sugarcane juice felt tastier as compared to the ones we get in Bangalore. It might have been expectations and preconceptions though (mountains and freshness yadda yadda). </p><p>The hike was still exhausting. A caution to the unfit first-timers, the stairs look very tempting, do not attempt those. It is very very difficult. Instead, walk at an easy pace and rest when tired.</p><p>Katra to Adhkuwari (the midway point) was the difficult stretch. We learned later that a new (a bit longer) route has been opened with a more forgiving incline. Adhkuwari, has another cave temple.  It doesn't have any artificial cave as at the top. As a result it is very difficult as at many points you have to crawl, and at the end someone has to drag you up the cave.  People go through in batches of 150 or so.  </p><p>We have not been fortunate to go through this cave in all the times we have been to Vaishno Devi. This place has another token system like at the top. We didn't take a token while climbing up as we were unsure if our turn be over by the time we return. We had booked a dormitory for the return stretch, planning to stay overnight and wait for our turn. </p><p>We now started on the home stretch. There is a new-ish route from Adhkuwari to the Bhavan (the main temple), which makes this very easy. Barring occasional steep sections, it is a very gentle slope. We covered that part (again around 6km) quickly and were at the Bhavan around 12:30 PM or so. From our experience, it is better to start as early as possible as it can get very warm while climbing. I would recommend to start latest by 7 AM and the hike would be easier. </p><p>At the Bhavan, we kept all our stuff in a locker. Mobile phones/belts/bags etc, the usual stuff are not allowed in the temple. We went and finished the Darshan very quickly due to the low crowd. The military pass further reduced the time. The Darshan went very well. As (honorary for her ;)) Delhiites, it was another milestone. We were all happy and tired. </p><p>By this time we were very hungry, except my sister who was feeling very faint and refused to have food. We force-fed her some sugar water, colloquially known as Coca Cola, while we had our lunch at a Sagar Ratna hotel. The food was superb, especially due to how hungry we were. After a yummy meal of Rajma Chawal, we started the next phase - Bhairav Temple. </p><p>Bhairav is the demon slayed by Vaishno Devi. There is a temple dedicated to the demon in the place where his head fell. A hero conquering an enemy and then the enemy becoming a protective deity is interesting. There was something similar in the Taktsang monastery in Paro. (We visited Bhutan for our honeymoon!)</p><p>This temple is around 3km uphill from the Bhavan. The route to Bhairav is tough and it takes almost 2 hours to cover this distance. But recently a ropeway was opened. At Rs 100 per person, we could cover the 3 hour up-down journey in an hour. The ropeway time is around a minute, the rest is waiting in the queue. </p><p>We were back at the Bhavan by 4 PM or so. After collecting our stuff from the locker, started the downhill hike to Adhkuwari.</p><p>The downhill hike presents a completely different challenge. You have to keep a control on the speed you are walking, lest you slip/fall. That leads to further strain on the knees and legs. We were all aching in different parts of the body by then. My mom was walking with a sling as her hand had started swelling and aching from no discernible cause. </p><p>We reached Adhkuwari around 6 PM and took a token for the Adhkuwari temple. Then we checked in to our dormitories. The facilities are very simple but neat and clean. On enquiry, the current group waiting for entry had coupon number 330 while ours was 551. Things looked very pessimistic. We gathered blankets for everyone and settled down for the night. (Security deposit of Rs 500 per blanket.) </p><p>My wife and I went out to get food for everyone. We shared some aaloo/paneer parantha. I got chowmein and fried rice for my sister and her brother respectively (both are addicts to those!). My dad was feeling feverish so he didn't want anything. My mom shared the chowmein. Tired and sleepy, we settled down for the night.</p><p>Waking up, we saw to our disappointment that the ongoing group number was still around 400. There was a teensy little relief as well. (Crawling through a cave is exciting before a 20km trek, intimidating after!)</p><p>It would take most of the day for our group's turn so we abandoned that plan and started the downhill trek to Katra. We navigated most of the downhill trek through the stairs. We reached the bottom a refueling stop and a pretty twisty wirey hanging stop later.</p><p>We made our way to the local general hospital as my mom's hand was now aching a lot. An X-ray and consultation later (it was diagnosed not serious), we made our way back to the IRCTC guesthouse. </p><p>There was a mixup as our reservation expired half an hour before we reached. We didn't realise and were on our way to the dormitory beds we thought were in our name. They were rude to us though, as if we were cheats. It felt bad, as it could have been resolved without all the drama. That was a black mark on the otherwise excellent guesthouse. We rebooked a few beds and then rested till our next train. </p><p>The next phase of our journey started at 2:35 PM on the Jammu Mail (code: 14034) to Pathankot Cantonment (code: PTKC). Pathankot Cantonment as that was the station enroute to Jwalamukhi, our next destination. We had booked a taxi from Pathankot that would take us there as well as 3 associated temples. That is a different blogpost though.</p><p>'Til Later</p></div>
