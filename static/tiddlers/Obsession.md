“Should we do it one more time?”

Her warm touch was answer enough for him. It had been a day he will never forget in his entire life. The frenetic activity had 
begun at 9 in the morning. And it was now 2:30 in the night. They had taken breaks only to eat food. His eyes had become puffy and
his back was hurting him. 

But he was determined. Years of taunts from his friends because of not doing it till his 4th year came 
back to him. He now wanted to ask each one of them whether they could even dream of doing it for as long as he had done. She was of
course more experienced but he felt that she understood his need. And that was enough for him. Someone who understood the fire 
inside, someone who would be there for him. And he did it one more time.

And kids, that is how in the monsoon of 2010 your father watched the final episode of the 5th season of “How I Met Your Mother” on
Uncle Abhishek’s computer.
