title: Missing Windows in GRUB
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

After installing Ubuntu, my Windows OS was missing from the GRUB. I fixed it using os-prober and then updating the GRUB.

```
#install os-prober, was already installed in my Ubuntu system
#sudo apt-get install os-prober
```
Then:

```
sudo os-prober 
sudo update-grub
reboot
```
