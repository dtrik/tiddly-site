Rejoice mortals, I am back.

I was unfortunately suffering from the common malady among aspiring bloggers called incompletepostitis. 
Every time I try to write something, I was reminded about the 4-5 incomplete posts lying in my drafts folder. I would flit in between them 
and end up completing none. With the well-being of my million followers foremost in my mind, I took the momentous step today of deleting 
all of them.

Mankind has surely lost some precious literature into the unseen corners of the interwebz but never fear, it is a minor compensation for 
the slew of posts that are about to grace the WWW inside the borders of istheurlavailable.

Once again, rejoice, the winter might be coming but not now. The good times are upon us ðŸ˜€
