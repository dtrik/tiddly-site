One of my fondest memories of my childhood is of my dear father reading me books. 

He used to insist that I read a paragraph and then would read me the rest. The usual fare was Asterix, Tintin, and all. While 
reading, he used to give different voices to the characters which somehow always sounded to be perfect for the character, like a 
deep voice for Obelix, a nice voice for Asterix, and an angry voice for the inimitable Captain Haddock. 

Thus began my love affair 
with books and I have to thank my Achhan for that. When talking about comics, Asterix has always been the first one that pops into
my mind. Being illiterate in French, I have only read the English version, but original or not, the books are imba. Whether it is 
the naming of the characters or the double or sometimes triple meanings in the dialogues, everything leaves a mark. Whether the 
fights between Unhygeinix and Fulliautomatix or the sarcastic comments about Geriatrixâ€™s age, the dialogues are just too good. 

And when it comes to Tintin, another of my favourites, Captain Haddock is the first thing that springs to my mind along with his 
choiciest swearwords. 

Talking about swearwords. Billions of Blue Blistering Barnacles, look at the time!!! Have to sleep now.
Thats all Folks
Toodles

PS: Forgot to mention the fact that I almost completely solved yesterdays crossword. But if the brainiacs at Hindu get even a whiff
of the fact that I found it to be easy, they make it ultra-hard next time. Still hoping for an easy one.
