Building habits is so hard. 
In Malayalam, we have a saying:

> ചൊട്ടയിലെ ശീലം ചുഡല വരെ  read as "chottayile Seelam chuDala vare"   

It means that habits formed in childhood last till your death. 

Morbid. But it feels very true while I am try to form new good habits and get rid of old bad habits. Of course there are a million resources online and elsewhere that aid you in your quest. But it is finally up to you to "get to it" as they say. 

It is really hard. Especially for someone like me who might well have been the muse for Newton's 1st Law. My favourite suggestion so far
regarding building habits has been about how it is best to add small steps to your pre-existing routine and add triggers for the habit 
you want to form. For eg, after an existing habit like brushing after waking up, drink a glass of water. Gradually drinking that glass of
water would be part of your routine. It is all about incremental progress - 1% improvement every day is 37 times improvement over a year.
Compounding is magic.

I am trying to add a few habits (never do more than say 3 or so). Let us see how it works out over time. 

'Til Later
