Like the mercury levels in my beloved Delhi, the boredness levels in La Palakkad scaled new peaks during the last week and it is expected to rise even more. 

There is something about being bored that brings out the best in a person and he digs deep into his creativity to escape his plight.
But Yours Truly has defied this convention and has slept more and more. 
It is during these sleep-induced stupors that I became philosophical and began wondering why I am doing all this. 
I desperately wanted an answer. 

But then I read Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and my whole viewpoint changed. Douglas Adams has 
pointed out in a rather hilarious way that instead of searching for answers to everything, we should first search for the proper 
questions. He has ridiculed how everyone wants the Ultimate Answer without knowing the Ultimate Question. An answer, however 
elegantly phrased, is incomplete without the right question. Mr Adams imagines the earth to be a gigantic computer aimed at 
finding the UQ. His point of view that human beings are the real guinea-pigs in this universal experiment is quite reasonable. 
The UQ has to be reached at by asking smaller significant questions on the way. 

It is this ability to ask questions that make 
humans what they are. A child asks questions to everything,but as we grow up we ask lesser and lesser questions, thereby losing our 
way to the UQ. Our pride and other petty feelings come in the way of our natural curiosity and block our path. Those who ask 
questions throughout their lives become great.

Quoting Marvin, ”It’s funny how just when you think life just can’t possibly get any worse it suddenly does." All that philosophy 
has made me even more bored. I do have to brighten up.
