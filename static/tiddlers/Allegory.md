I and my sister had a fight once. We started shouting loudly and were thoroughly “enjoying” ourselves. In the middle, I impulsively pulled
her hair and she started crying loudly. 

Another cousin who saw this immediately called my Dad who pulled us apart and gave me a good scolding.

Mom was not present at that time as she had gone for shopping. When she heard about our fight, she immediately became angry and started 
scolding me. She threatened to revoke my computer privileges. 

My grandparents came to my defense that though we fought a lot, this was the first time that it had escalated to physical violence. 
This angered my mom further and finally I ended up losing my computer privileges for 3 weeks instead of the 2 days that I usually get 
for being at fault.

When asked about it, she informed me that me fighting in front of my younger cousin as well as protesting my innocence were all bad 
mistakes. My grandparents shouldn’t have defended me either though it was beyond my control. Also it turns out that my other relatives had
heard about this from said cousin and laughed at us thereby embarrassing my family.

I stopped talking back when I realised that it might further anger her and lead to more punishment. So this is my last post for some time.

PS: This is how I understand how the Suarez biting “scandal” plays out in my small world
