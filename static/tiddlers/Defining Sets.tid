title: Defining Sets
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sets can be defined with an inclusion criteria using a set builder notation.

eg: $$ A = \{x \in X | f(x) = 0\} $$ means the set $$ A $$  is defined as having all the elements $$ x $$  belonging to the space $$ X $$ such that the condition $$ f(x) = 0 $$ is true.
