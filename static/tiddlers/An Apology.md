My bad! I never should have made such a promise. Ambitious seems to be an understatement. C’mon who was I kidding! 8 blogs? Me?
With an extremely high affinity towards laziness, that was never going to happen. My memoirs will have to be written by someone 
else. 

Sad. 

This time even I am disappointed by my inability. As a result of that commitment, I have not done anything else either, I mean no 
other blogposts. Whenever I used to get any ideas, I think “But I still have not done what I promised”. So I temporarily postpone 
that commitment. I will be posting other things meanwhile. Maybe in the middle of all that, a sem or two might pop in.

Note: “MAY” pop in.

So long and thanks for all the fish.
