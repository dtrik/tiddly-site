title: Age of Magic

The Age of Gods is something that researchers have named this era we live in. It cannot be precisely dated but is assumed to have started after the sixth war between King Vishwapala and the demons of Yamapuri when while trying to retreat from a rout, a nameless soldier in the rearguard invoked the concept of fire while defending her besieged comrades. Eyewitness accounts from that battle state that her sword lit up with an a holy golden fire the demons couldn’t suffer. It is reported that the fire swept through the enemy ranks who were reduced to ashes. For that deed, the soldier was given leadership of the company she rescued. Her real name has been lost in the annals of history. There are further records of battles where Agni’s presence is indicated only by the ashes left behind of her enemies. The sparse nature of the earlier records indicate that the person known now as Agni didn’t always have full control over the fires she was able to invoke and was used more as desperate measure at the beginning though that changed later. In the last battle of the last war between Vishwapala and Yamapuri, there are records of a weapon used by Agni in collaboration with her battalion where Agni is said to have invoked the golden fires and shaped it in the form of a gigantic spoked ring that then swept through the entire enemy ranks and reduced the strength of the demon army to such an extent that they were not able to ever recover to be a threat. Agni’s battalion was also lost in this and it was later revealed that the fire was powered by the life force of the people invoking the fire. This sacrificial weapon which we now know as the Samhara is spoken about in hushed tones not just because of its all consuming nature and utter intent to destroy your enemies but also the acceptance to lay down your life.
