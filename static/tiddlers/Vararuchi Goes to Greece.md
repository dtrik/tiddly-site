Spend your adolescence slaving for that extra something that separates you from the rest of the herd, not knowing why.

Impress someone who was you five years ago to get paid to do something that you don’t like and no one cares about.

Stand in queues to get loans to buy possessions that you don’t need, trying to forget that the bank owns it now.

Yearn for companionship, trying to find someone who might help you understand why you are doing what you are doing.

Pick a cause that you feel validates your existence, trying to forget that you never do anything meaningful for it.

Hate yourself a bit when that cause fails, or hate the cause when it proves meaningless to your life.

Understand sometime in the future, (maybe as an epiphany, maybe not so), that life doesn’t need meaning, it goes on.

Strive to ensure that your future offspring isn’t pushing this same rock up the hill, knowing that you will fail.
