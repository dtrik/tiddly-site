As I have mentioned before, I LOVE reading. 

Once I get a book, I cannot stop until I have finished it. 
It is sort of a fight between us. I say “Aha, x pages finished”. He says “Young man, y pages are still left”. Inevitably I win, 
but the bigger the book, the longer the contest goes on. 
Though I thoroughly enjoy this “War of words”, two people are not at all 
pleased at this. One is of course my mother as I tend to forget everything with a book in my hand. The other person is Mr. Hunger 
who also gets forgotten. And he gets really angry at that. So he hits back really hard. Then it is left to my mother to do the 
damage control (which further fuels her anger). 

My addiction doesn’t stop at books. I am also addicted to computers. So I have clubbed the two and begun to read e-books. I agree, 
of course, that a computer can never substitute a book, but still beggars can’t be choosers. During the furore around the time of 
release of HPDH, I was madly searching the net for the supposedly leaked copies (sorry JKR). During that time I read many 
fanfictions and of course the brilliant spoof. I daresay the spoof was better than the original (of course minus the sex part in 
the spoof, not that I have anything against sex, but somehow Harry Potter and sex don’t seem to mix). 

Another good fan-fiction 
that I read was posted on Sugarquill. It was for the Order of the Pheonix. I have always felt that HP was sadly lacking in duels 
ever since Dumbledore and Voldy gave us a taste of it. But this book has some scintillating duels and some fantastic concepts. 
You may wonder that haven’t I outgrown HP. But there is something about magic which keeps me spellbound (no pun intended). 

Instead 
of focussing on what magic is being used to do, the author has focussed upon the nature of magic. She has categorised magic into 
two types, dormant which is called Aether and moving which is called Numen. She says that the aether is converted into numen when 
it moves through our heart (which acts like a prism). For any magic to be done, the heart has to be willing. 
Quoting her, 
“there are no dark arts, only dark hearts”. So a person who is at peace with himself can convert all the numen back into aether 
(like an inverted prism). That, I think is a fantastic concept. Any jobless person who is interested should go to Sugarquill and 
search for Pheonix and the Serpent. 

But have to go now, my best friend sleep is calling me.
