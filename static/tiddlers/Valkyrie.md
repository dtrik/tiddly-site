One winter he sailed forth,  
Away, afar to the dark cold north,  
His mind set on the stories told,  
By voyagers young and old,  
He thought of that fateful night,  
When he ran away feeling light.

Tales of treasure beyond measure,  
Filled his heart with great pleasure,  
Lands so beautiful with fjords and brooks,  
Mountains and forests wherever one looks,  
But most he dreamt of the chance to see,  
Herja the Great valkyrie.

Her beauty renowned far and wide,  
As was her anger which swept like a tide,  
There was a hush when they spoke her name,  
All the noise it overcame,  
She rode upon a fair white horse,  
And ruled with force the mighty Norse.

The journey lasted many a new moon,  
He raved alone like a crazed loon,  
Storms tore apart the humble sails,  
The thunder silenced his rants and wails,  
Hunger and thirst rent his mind,  
No land or ship he could find.

One day he felt so tired and sore,  
He wept aloud and gave a huge roar,  
Cursed everyone who told him the lore,  
Decided to die and live no more,  
He ran and grabbed the only oar,  
But lo! he beheld a great white shore.

He rowed afresh with hopes high,  
A smile on his face only so wry,  
Paddled so much he ran aground,  
But screamed with joy and jumped around,  
Saw a forest and went inside,  
From the bitter cold he wanted to hide.

He strove on with much courage,  
Once again he felt young of age,  
Then there came along a fresh trail,  
Believed again that he would not fail,  
He walked and walked till he fell,  
Then awoke to the sound of a tinkling bell.

Wonder filled him as he became,  
Aware at last of the splendid name,  
Of the place he found himself,  
Tended upon by a noble elf,  
Whereupon he went he saw great lords,  
For this was Valhalla the hall of Gods.

He drank the sights and his soul was healed,  
Such powers the gods did wield,  
Once the wounds all did clear,  
Again the desire through his heart did sear,  
To see the Lady Herja great,  
He felt so sure it was his fate.

When the lords heard his wish they smiled,  
They said to him, “Dear child,  
We hope you pine for something else,  
For her eyes deep as wells,  
Will blind your mortal eyes,  
We assure you we speak no lies”.

But he would not have his wish denied,  
Peeked at her at a royal ride,  
The lady atop her splendid steed,  
She felt his presence and gave him heed,  
Blinding him before he would see,  
Herja the Great valkyrie.
