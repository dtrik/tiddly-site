What would I not give for a work laptop which is plain Linux. Just give me ssh or whatever to the work vpn and let me work happily. Now I am connecting to a remote desktop that is connected to a different remote desktop that I connect to a different Linux machine on which the vast majority of my work is done. Impossible to work on a poor connection.
