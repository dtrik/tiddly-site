I am taking part in the Summer of Data Science this time. Details about what it is can be found at this excellent [ext[blog|https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/]]

Summarising the idea, it involves picking a topic or course or book in the broad domain of data science and working on it over a period of 
3 months (a summer), typically June-July-August. 

I made an attempt at this last summer but ended up not doing anything. I want to do better (not that hard to be fair!). So this time, I made
the pledge publicly and have picked the latest version of the two Fast.Ai courses - [[Practical Deep Learning for Coders|https://course.fast.ai/part1]]
and [[Deep Learning from the Foundations|https://course.fast.ai/part2]]. Do check out [ext[fast.ai|fast.ai]] for more details about the course 
including materials covered and the teaching philosophy itself. 

Though I made the pledge last month and did make several inroads, it hasn't been consistent. So I am restarting it starting tomorrow. There
are 14 lessons and about 30 hours of videos. I am planning to complete two lectures a week starting tomorrow. So I hope to complete the 
lessons within ~1.5 months. When I say complete two lectures a week, I mean I will be watching the lectures and making notes, then going 
through the lesson materials and (Jupyter) notebooks. I am also going to post a summary of what I worked on each day. I might make a 
separate page detailing these as I do not want those posts to interfere with [[my one pomodoro a post idea|Motivation]]. 
I aim to finish all this in at most 2 months. I am planning to invest 2 hours at least every weekday on this (weekends intermittently).  

I want to form ideas on how I can utilize this learning for my work and spend the rest of the time (~1 month) on this as well as trying out
Kaggle. 

In my next post tomorrow, I will write a short post about a trek we did at Handi Gundi Betta today (July 6th, 2019) as well as a funny 
incident that happened. 

'Til Later
