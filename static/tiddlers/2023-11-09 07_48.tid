The stream of atrocities coming out of Gaza is just so heartbreaking. I can't imagine the sheer fortitude of the Palestinian people living through relentless siege and war crimes. Shame on the world, especially the US and other western nations on not just being a passive observer but being an active and enthusiastic cheerleader and supporter of this ethnic cleansing masquerading as an "anti-terrorism" campaign. It has been definitely interesting to see Germany taking all the wrong lessons from the Holocaust. It is jarring to see Israeli leaders quite openly stating their aims to kick/kill every Palestinian and trying their best to openly follow through on this and celebrating each innocent murder. "Milky toast" liberals handwringing over the liberation slogans of the oppressed and both-siding this so-called conflict is not unexpected tbh. 
At least the right-wingers are honest about their happiness in the wholesale murder of Muslims.
