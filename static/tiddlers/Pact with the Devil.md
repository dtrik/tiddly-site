Once upon a time, when the world was young and Yours Truly still believed in WWE (that is really long back, I swear), 
my best friend Mr. Sleep, came to me and told me, “See boy, the harder you try avoid me, the more will I keep you, so it is best 
to embrace me earlier and I may* leave you earlier.” 

The innocent fool I was, I did not read the fine print too carefully and 
did not read the “*-terms and conditions apply”. Those were the times when exams were a joke and regular studying was yet to be 
discovered. Soon I became a Kumbhakarna waking up only the day of the examination to go there, finish it as early as possible and
continue my forty winks. 

Slowly as the world aged, the teachers became progressively evil and soon exams gave an opportunity to start praying, 
“welcome back Mr. God”. It was then when sleepless nights were needed and were rather scarce that I took out the old dusty
records of my “Pact with the Devil” and read the fine print with a microscope. 

Apparently, early morning awakenings were only when the situation warranted it. 
According to Mr. Sleep, that meant the morning of the examination. Add this to my second favourite hobby-procrastination, you can 
understand my situation. So I turned to stimulants like coffee and tea, which I drank till the caffeine threatened to spill out, 
but these filled me up, and when I am full, I tend to sleep. 

Somebody please help me... 

Oh no he is coming, I have to go now, or he may get angry.
