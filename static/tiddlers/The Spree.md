Judging by my Google as well as my Twitter status updates, the more perceptive of my followers would have probably guessed that I am on a 
reading spree now. 

It is something which strikes me every now and then when I go through an inordinate number of books at a rather quick pace. In the last 10 days I have read 5 books, not bad eh? Arrogant !@#!@ you might be thinking, but what the hell :)!

I was going through a rather lean spell in the reading department when I decided to buy two books at once. They were Old Man and the Sea 
by Ernest Hemingway and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John Le Carre. I was actually going to buy only the former paying heed to the dire
warnings by ICICI about the state of my funds but when I saw that Flipkart had increased the minimum amount for free delivery, I thought 
what the hell and ordered the other too. And that opened the proverbial flood-gates. A lunch at a nice hotel opposite our house finally 
led me to step into the hallowed premises of [ext[JustBooks|http://www.justbooksclc.com/Welcome]]. I had been giving the place a wide berth 
relating to the aforementioned depletion of funds but once I went inside, there was no escape.

For the uninformed, JustBooks is a lending library with a host of plans for different types of readers. It has a very large collection
of books and all the books are beautifully maintained. They also have a very modern system with RFID cards for the members and similar tags
on the book jackets.  After going in, I couldn’t wait to go back as the Jeeves omnibus Vol 3 and Silmarillion were too hot to handle in my
hand. I took the plan for 200 Rs, by which I could borrow two books at a time. There was a joining fee and a refundable fee. The best
1.5 k that I might have spent in recent memory, I might add.

I will try to give a short review of the books that I have read in the span of the past few days, hopefully a post a book and hopefully 
something that might lead you to one of these books all of which I quite enjoyed.

’til Later
