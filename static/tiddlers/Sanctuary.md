My training centre has been sort of a sanctuary for me.

Sanctuary incidentally in both ways. In one way, it has been a place where I can seek shelter from boredom (I thought that I had shelter,
but immediately realised my grave mistake). In another way, it has been a place where I could observe the working human species (homo 
worko sapiens), in their natural habitat. 

I confess that my opinion about the species is far from good. Doing the same work all day long, 
is for robots or machines in my opinion. If I was there only for a few hours, then they would have undoubtedly shown their professional 
side,but being there for the entire day, they must have decided to drop the act. Câ€™mon, how long can a person keep up an act?!! So I could
witness the Behind the Scenes action, the timed work, the untimed breaks, the small fights and of course, the inevitable boss-bashing. It 
has really been a learning experience for me about what to expect and what not to expect from work. Sort of makes me want to retire 
straight after studies. 

But what to do, stomach has to be filled! Expecting better from my job, when I get one (God knows when !).
