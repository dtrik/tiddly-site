In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God but then he got stuck because he got writer's block. At least that is what
happens to me. The Abrahamic God managed to create the perfect world in 6 days and then he rested. But I ended up doing very little
chasing perfection. Well I did rest a lot. 

Providence or not, there has been a spate of posts and [ext[tweets|https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1146665360537657345]] recently about putting out a body of work after editing it well and just keep 
on doing it till you are good. I am inspired. Especially by this [[post|http://matthewrocklin.comwork/2019/06/25/write-short-blogposts]].

So this is my plan for the short term at least. I am planning to write something that I can finish publishing in 1 pomodoro or less. At the end
of it, I will include some detail about what my next post will be about and when it is going to be published (on the order of days, not hours).

This is an intro-type post and I will have a post tomorrow about the Summer of Data Science and what my plan is to be. 

'Til Later
