Eagerly checking the timeline of my twitter page, occasionally checking my mail, sometimes running off to play a quick round of 
carrom, rarely going to meet my mentor, and once in a while reading some study materials I wanted to read, here I am peacefully
sipping a hot mug of tea waiting to be eventually assigned to my first project. Or have I already been assigned?
