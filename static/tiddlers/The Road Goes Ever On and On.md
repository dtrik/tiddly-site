College is beckoning and the seemingly endless holidays are drawing to a close. 

As much as I enjoy college life, there is a sad feeling on thinking of stupid timetables, washing your own clothes and in short being
responsible for yourself (The second one never fails to evoke a groan). 

The first time at the college was particularly sad. The warmth of my mother’s hug where I always secure, father’s presence where there 
becomes nothing to worry about as it will always be solved, and my little sister with whom I fight every single moment but whom I can’t let
anyone else hurt, all were part of my first journey to the college.

Well all this went into the backseat of my mind after the first few days, the “making friends” period, but it will always remain there. 
Though all this sounds cliched, it is true nevertheless. I guess this is all part of the “Growing Up”. A big part of my heart wishes that 
I was back to my school days, where the only thing that was to be worried about was the next exam. Even now, our lives are relatively
sheltered, except that we are away from our parents. But come a day, when every morning has new worries, new bills to pay, then maybe 
college life will seem heavenly. 

Well, one can’t really blame a human for always wanting something which he doesn’t have, its only human. The same forlorn feeling has come
back to haunt me though it will be my third year into college. But leaving sentimental matters aside, this year is going to be the year
when the future will be decided, whether I will be just another casualty to recession or a young man with a bright future. Of course
placements come only next year but the buildup to it is important. Working hard seems to be the only option available, something which I 
incidentally despise, but what else can be done. This is a short farewell to blogosphere as once in college, I leave Roci behind and have 
to wait till I get a laptop, which I hope is quite soon. Or else I have to turn to my roomies who I trust will be “Friends in need…”.

Finishing my adieu with the great words of a great man…

> The Road goes ever on and on  
> Down from the door where it began.  
> Now far ahead the Road has gone,  
> And I must follow, if I can,  
> Pursuing it with weary feet,  
> Until it joins some larger way,  
> Where many paths and errands meet.  
> And whither then? I cannot say.  

That’s all folks

PS: My blog seems to be chokeful of cliches but what to do…
