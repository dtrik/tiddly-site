And I am back.

Just like Sherlock Holmes was presumed to perish at Reichenbach Falls but was brought back after relentless pressure by his devotees, my 
blog almost dead after Dudhsagar Falls is back in the blogosphere after constant pressure from my followers (Read: my alter-ego Readerman,
he is really devoted). This self-enforced exile was not anything related to anything. It was just a patent lack of ideas or inspiration to 
write anything, what people better than me have called Writerâ€™s Block.

Life has been relatively smooth in the interlude, and the occasional speed bumps rendered no more damage than a night in a Kerala SRTC 
sooper fast bus on the Bangalore-Kozhikode route. The job chugs along about fine, learning new stuff and having a lot of fun and arguments
with my colleagues as well.

I will be back with a proper block, sorry blogpost now that I have rid myself of my block. Or so I think. Let us wait and see, though
Readerman, my only subscriber better be ready for a deluge of mails regarding new posts in the coming few days.
