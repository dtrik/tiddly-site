So the day has come. We must part ways. It is not your fault alone. I have met someone else. And has everything that I wanted. It
was good while it lasted, but this relationship cannot last longer. Hope you meet someone else who is more committed to you than me. 
I will always have fond memories of you.

So long Blogger. But ~~Tumblr~~ WordPress is so much more cooler than you. You can send over my stuff  here.

Toodles then.
