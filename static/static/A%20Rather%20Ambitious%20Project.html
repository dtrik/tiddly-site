Yes, life will most probably be an uphill journey 
from now on. This last semester of pure enjoyment will I guess be like the rest at the base camp before the actual ascent is 
attempted. Thus it seems to be a good time to recap upon how I reached this base camp. Hey don‚Äôt worry, it will not be a long drawn
out narrative of all that I did since I began to remember. That is the job of my biographer after I become famous :).  </p><p>I rather hope to write a series of blogs giving the most memorable moments and people I have met since my college life began. 
Hopefully there will be a blog on each semester, though my memory is rather faint regarding some parts :).</p><p>College life, especially hostel life has been a fantastic experience for me.  I learned many things that I would never have learnt
in the not ordinary course of life  (engineering is the ordinary course of life now üôÇ ). I daresay, it has rubbed a few odd 
corners off me. When I joined this college I had no expectations other than maybe an IT job. To be frank, I had no idea what to 
expect from here. I had no idea what the standard of education will be, what type of teachers I will study from or even what type
of people I will be studying with. My book of expectations was blank and was slowly written in as the days progressed. Maybe I had 
a small hope of making some good friends. Ah yes! I also wanted to be able to avoid alcohol and smoke. And of course remain a 
vegetarian. Thats it. </p><p>And have my expectations been fulfilled? A big resounding yessss!!! I have met  many nice people, made many nice friends, at least
some of whom I hope will remain so for the rest of my life. And of course I have always been able to say a strong no to both
alcohol and smoke. And yes I have stayed a vegetarian though I am not sure whether that is something to be proud of or not. At
least I now have more confidence in my ability to say no. </p><p>If I miss anybody or anything in my description, it is only my bad memory at the time of writing that caused that miss. I assure
that whoever you are or whatever that happened would have been included if I had perfect recollection of everything that ever
occurred ( in that case I will be a miracle and would be writing this from the confines of a lab with scientists poking at my 
brain). Of course the journey this far has not been a smooth ride and there have been my fair share of hiccups and breakdowns. 
But what is the point of remembering bad things? I hope to maintain a rather lighthearted account of everything though I hasten
to add that I would have more often than not understood the gravity of the situation.</p><p>So keep visiting once in a while to see how far my project has progressed.</p><p>Toodles
